# How to Form a New York PLLC

The complete do-it-yourself guide to Office of the Professions approval, Department of State filing, and the 6-week publication requirement

## INTRODUCTION

New York requires professional entities to jump through a few extra hoops compared to regular LLCs. A PLLC needs approval from the Office of the Professions (OP) before the Department of State (DOS) will accept your filing. After that, you'll still need to complete the six-week publication requirement in two county-designated newspapers and file a Certificate of Publication.

The process requires careful attention to detail and coordination between multiple agencies. Small mistakes—a misplaced comma, an inconsistent date, or filing with the wrong newspaper—can result in rejections that set you back weeks or even months. Each rejection means paying filing fees again, restarting publication runs, and losing valuable time when you need to be focusing on your practice.

If you're willing to invest the time and handle the details carefully, this guide will walk you through the entire process. However, many professionals find that the time commitment, risk of costly mistakes, and complexity of coordinating between agencies makes it worth having experts handle the process instead.

## WHAT YOU'LL NEED BEFORE YOU START

Before diving in, gather the following information:

- The exact legal names of all members/managers as they appear on their NY professional licenses
- License numbers and current status for each professional owner/manager
- The county where your PLLC office will be located (this determines where you'll publish)
- A mailing address for service of process (where the DOS will forward legal mail)
- At least two compliant name options that end with "PLLC"
- Access to a printer/scanner for documents
- A calendar to track important deadlines (120-day publication window and biennial statement dates)
- Several hours of uninterrupted time to prepare packets and coordinate with newspapers
- Patience for potential back-and-forth with state agencies

---

## STEP 1 — CHOOSING YOUR NAME & CONFIRMING ELIGIBILITY

The first step is to pick a name that both OP and DOS will accept, and to make sure everyone involved holds the proper licenses. This seemingly simple step is where many people encounter their first roadblock.

**Here's what to do:**

Come up with 3-5 name options that end with "PLLC". Make sure they don't include any restricted terms that your profession doesn't allow. (Different professions have different naming restrictions that aren't always clearly documented.)

Check each name in the DOS corporation/LLC database search to see if there are any conflicts. Even similar names can cause issues down the road, and determining what's "too similar" isn't always clear-cut.

Confirm that every owner and manager holds an active New York license for the specific profession your PLLC will practice. You'll want to save screenshots or PDFs of the license lookups because OP may question them later.

Once you've settled on a name, lock it in—exact spelling, punctuation, spacing, and capitalization. You'll be using this exact name throughout the entire process: on OP forms, in your Articles of Organization, in the newspaper notice, on bank documents, and on the Certificate of Publication. A single inconsistency anywhere in the chain can derail your entire filing.

**What typically goes wrong:**

- Name doesn't follow your profession's specific naming rules → OP rejects your application, adding weeks to the process
- Changing punctuation or spacing later → your publication notice won't match the DOS record, requiring you to restart and pay for publication again
- Including someone who isn't properly licensed as a member/manager → OP holds up your application indefinitely until you fix it
- Name is too similar to an existing entity → rejection after you've already paid filing fees

---

## STEP 2 — PREPARING THE OFFICE OF THE PROFESSIONS APPLICATION

Your first major hurdle is getting OP to issue a Certificate of Authority, which authorizes your PLLC to practice your profession. This agency review can take several weeks, and any mistakes in your packet will result in a deficiency letter that adds more time to the process.

**Here's how to put together your application packet:**

**Cover Letter (1 page):**

At the top, include your exact PLLC name, profession, and contact information (name, phone, email).

In the body, write something like: "Enclosed please find our application for a Certificate of Authority to form a [Profession] PLLC. Members/managers and license numbers are listed below."

Sign and date it.

**Entity Application Forms:**

Use OP's forms specifically for professional entities forming new PLLCs (not PCs, and not foreign entities). Finding the correct form version can be tricky, as the OP website isn't always intuitive to navigate.

Enter your exact PLLC name everywhere it appears on the forms—and it appears multiple times. Even one variation can trigger a rejection.

List each member and manager with their NY license number and role. If you're setting up a manager-managed structure, make sure to state that clearly. Vague language here often results in follow-up questions from OP.

Include a brief description of the professional services you'll be providing, using terminology appropriate to your profession. Generic descriptions may not satisfy OP's requirements.

**Roster Addendum (create your own):**

Make a simple table with these columns: Full Name (as it appears on license), License #, Issue Date, Status, Role (Member/Manager), and Ownership %.

The ownership percentages must add up to exactly 100%. Even a 0.1% discrepancy will be caught.

**Double-check everything:**

Go through your cover letter, forms, and roster to make sure the PLLC name is identical everywhere. This is tedious but critical—mismatches are one of the most common reasons for rejection.

**Assembly:**

Put your cover letter on top, followed by the OP forms and your roster addendum.

Add any other required documents your profession may need (like consents or good-standing certificates). Requirements vary by profession and aren't always clearly spelled out.

Make a clean PDF scan of the complete packet and save it with a clear filename like "OP-PLLC-[YourName]-[Date].pdf". You'll need this when OP calls with questions.

**Mailing:**

Send your packet using a service with tracking (like USPS Priority Mail or certified mail).

Include your phone and email on the cover letter in case OP needs to reach you. They typically call during business hours, so you'll need to be available.

Keep the tracking number with your PDF for reference.

**What typically goes wrong:**

- Inconsistencies between the name, roster, or license information → OP sends a deficiency letter 2-4 weeks later, restarting the clock
- Missing signatures or incorrect role designations → packet gets returned weeks after you sent it
- Not keeping a copy → when OP calls with questions, you can't reference what you actually submitted
- Using outdated forms → automatic rejection
- License number doesn't match state records exactly → delays while OP investigates

---

## STEP 3 — FOLLOWING UP WITH THE OFFICE OF THE PROFESSIONS

After you've sent your packet, you'll enter a waiting period where you have limited visibility into where your application stands. OP doesn't provide online tracking, so you'll need to call for updates.

**Here's what to do:**

Set a calendar reminder to check on the status about two weeks after your packet is delivered. Have your PLLC name, profession, and mailing date ready when you call. Be prepared for long hold times.

If OP sends you a deficiency letter (requesting additional information or corrections), respond to exactly what they're asking for. Reference their letter date in your reply. Deficiency responses that include extra information or changes beyond what was requested can create new issues.

When OP issues your Certificate of Authority (it's a sealed document), make at least two scans: one for your records and one for your DOS filing packet. Keep the original in pristine condition—any damage to the seal can cause problems later.

**What typically goes wrong:**

- Vague or incomplete responses to deficiency letters → OP sends a second deficiency request, adding another 2-4 weeks
- Changing the PLLC name mid-process → you have to restart the entire OP approval process
- Missing OP's phone calls → delays while they try to reach you
- Not following up proactively → your packet can sit for weeks before you realize there's an issue

---

## STEP 4 — PREPARING YOUR ARTICLES OF ORGANIZATION

Now it's time to prepare the paperwork for DOS. You'll be filing "Articles of Organization (Professional Service)", not the standard LLC form. Using the wrong form is one of the most common and frustrating mistakes—it results in automatic rejection after weeks of processing time.

**Here's what to include:**

**Entity name:** Use the exact same name you used with OP. Any variation will cause problems.

**Professional service:** Specify your actual profession (like "law" or "engineering"), not just "any lawful purpose." Generic language will get rejected.

**County location:** Enter the county where your PLLC office is located. This determines where you'll need to publish later, and changing it later is extremely complicated.

**Service of process:** Designate the Secretary of State as your agent and provide the mailing address where legal documents should be forwarded. This address must exactly match what you'll use in your publication notice, or you'll have to redo publication.

**Management structure:** Indicate whether you're member-managed or manager-managed. This should match what you told OP, or you'll face questions from both agencies.

**Organizer information:** Include the name and signature of the person filing (often a member or authorized organizer).

**Attachments:** Include your OP Certificate of Authority (or the attorney equivalent if applicable). Forgetting this attachment is the #1 reason for DOS rejection.

**How to assemble the packet:**

1. Cover letter to DOS (include your name, contact info, and any expedite request)
2. Articles of Organization (Professional Service)
3. OP Certificate of Authority (or attorney certificate)
4. Payment form (check or credit card authorization)

**What typically goes wrong:**

- Using the standard LLC form instead of the Professional Service version → automatic rejection after weeks of processing
- Forgetting to attach the OP Certificate of Authority → rejection and you have to refile
- Service of process address doesn't match what you'll use in your publication notice later → publication rejection months down the line
- County doesn't match your OP application → questions from both agencies
- Payment form filled out incorrectly → filing sits in limbo until you correct it

---

## STEP 5 — FILING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE

Send your complete packet to DOS and decide whether you want expedited processing (highly recommended given the standard processing times).

**Here's what to do:**

Mail your packet using a trackable service.

Consider paying for expedited processing. Standard processing times can stretch for many months, during which you can't officially operate your PLLC.

When you receive your filing receipt, scan it immediately and save it with a clear filename. Keep it with your other core documents. This receipt is the only official proof of your PLLC's existence—DOS doesn't issue a fancy certificate.

**What typically goes wrong:**

- Losing the filing receipt—DOS will not replace it, and you'll have major problems opening bank accounts or proving your PLLC exists
- Assuming approval means you're done—you still have the publication requirement, and it's time-sensitive
- Not noticing a rejection for weeks because you weren't tracking the mail carefully
- Filing receipt arrives but has an error on it—correcting these takes additional time and correspondence

---

## STEP 6 — COMPLETING THE PUBLICATION REQUIREMENT

This is the most complex, time-consuming, and expensive part of the process. You'll need to publish a notice for six consecutive weeks in two county-designated newspapers (one weekly and one daily), and you have only 120 days from your filing date to complete this step. Miss this deadline, and your PLLC's authority to do business will be suspended until you cure the publication—which means starting the entire six-week process over again.

**Finding the designated newspapers:**

Each county has its own list of approved newspapers for LLC/PLLC publication. You can't just pick any newspaper—it must be one officially designated by your county, and these lists change periodically.

Finding the correct newspapers can be time-consuming. County clerk offices don't always have updated lists easily accessible, and you may need to make multiple calls to confirm which papers are currently designated.

**Drafting your notice:**

Your publication notice must match your DOS record exactly. Even a single character difference will result in rejection of your Certificate of Publication months later, forcing you to restart the entire six-week publication process and pay both newspapers again.

Use this format:

```
NOTICE OF FORMATION of [Exact PLLC Name]. Articles of Organization filed with
NY Dept. of State on [Formation Date]. Office location: [County]. Secretary of
State designated as agent for service of process; shall mail to [Mailing Address].
Purpose: Practice of [Profession] and any lawful activities authorized for a PLLC.
```

You'll need to verify that your name, date, county, mailing address, and profession are all exactly correct. Don't trust memory—compare character-by-character against your DOS filing receipt.

**Contacting the newspapers:**

Send an email to both newspapers with a subject line like "Legal Notice — PLLC Formation — [Your PLLC Name]."

Include your notice text, contact information, and ask for a quote, proposed run dates, and a proof for your approval.

Be prepared for slow responses. Many designated newspapers aren't set up for high-volume correspondence, and you may need to follow up multiple times.

When you receive the proof, compare every single character to your DOS filing receipt before approving it. Once publication starts with an error, you'll have to pay to restart the entire six-week run.

**Running the notice:**

The notice must run for six consecutive weeks in both papers. If either paper misses a week, you have to start the entire process over. If you realize mid-run that there's an error in the text, you have to start over.

Coordinating two different newspapers to run simultaneously for six weeks without any missed issues requires careful follow-up. You'll need to confirm with each paper that your notice is running each week.

After the six-week run is complete, both newspapers will send you affidavits (sworn statements that the notice ran as required). Sometimes these arrive promptly; sometimes you'll need to chase them down with multiple calls and emails.

Scan and save both affidavits immediately when they arrive. These are legal documents you'll need to file with DOS.

**What typically goes wrong:**

- Using newspapers that aren't on the current designated list → the entire six-week run doesn't count and you have to start over with the correct papers
- A single typo in the name or date → DOS rejects your Certificate of Publication and you have to republish for six weeks and pay again
- One newspaper misses a week → the run doesn't count as "consecutive" and you start over
- Missing the 120-day deadline → your PLLC's authority to do business is suspended until you cure publication
- Newspaper affidavits arrive with errors or missing information → DOS rejects them and you need corrected versions
- Losing track of which week you're on → uncertainty about whether the run was truly consecutive
- One paper goes out of business mid-run → you have to restart with a different paper
- Address in notice doesn't match DOS record → rejection months later

**Cost reality:**

Publication costs vary widely by county. New York County (Manhattan) and the Bronx can easily exceed $1,000 just for publication. Other counties may be several hundred dollars. These costs are unavoidable, and you'll have to pay them all over again if anything goes wrong with your publication.

---

## STEP 7 — FILING THE CERTIFICATE OF PUBLICATION

Once you have both affidavits, you'll need to file a Certificate of Publication with DOS. This step has its own specific requirements for assembly order—get it wrong and your filing will be rejected.

**Here's what to do:**

Download the Certificate of Publication form for PLLCs from the DOS website. Make sure you're using the current version.

Fill it out with your exact PLLC name (it usually appears in multiple places), county, and your contact information. Any variation in the name from your Articles will cause rejection.

**Assemble the packet in this specific order:**

1. Certificate of Publication (page 1)
2. Affidavit from the weekly newspaper
3. Affidavit from the daily newspaper
4. Certificate of Publication (page 2)

The affidavits need to be "sandwiched" between the two pages of the Certificate in exactly this order. DOS is strict about this—wrong order means rejection.

Include the payment form for the DOS filing fee ($50, plus additional for expedite if desired).

Mail the complete packet to DOS using a trackable service. Save a PDF of everything you're sending.

**What typically goes wrong:**

- Wrong assembly order → rejection weeks or months later
- Name on Certificate doesn't match the DOS record exactly → rejection
- Address doesn't match what was published → rejection
- Affidavits are photocopies instead of originals → rejection
- One of the affidavits is missing required elements → rejection
- Filing without expedite → 7-9 months of processing time
- Not keeping copies → when rejected, you can't easily see what you submitted

**Processing time:**

Without expedited processing, you're looking at 7-9 months for the state to process your Certificate of Publication. Even with expedite, mailing time adds 10-14 days to the process. During this time, you're waiting to receive your filing receipt, which is your only proof that publication was properly completed.

---

## STEP 8 — GETTING YOUR EIN, OPENING A BANK ACCOUNT, AND FILING ASSUMED NAMES

After your PLLC is officially formed and publication is complete, you can move forward with day-to-day operations—but there are still a few administrative tasks that can present challenges.

**Here's what to do:**

Apply for an EIN (Employer Identification Number) from the IRS. The online process is usually straightforward, but you'll need to have all your formation documents organized.

Open a business bank account using your DOS filing receipt and your Operating Agreement. Banks often require specific documents and refuse to accept alternatives, so call ahead to confirm exactly what they need.

If you plan to do business under a different name (for marketing, website, invoices, etc.), file a Certificate of Assumed Name with DOS. This creates an official record linking your trade name to your PLLC.

**What typically goes wrong:**

- Bank requires an Operating Agreement you haven't created yet—you'll need to draft one before your appointment or reschedule
- Bank wants a "certified copy" of your Articles—DOS charges for these and they take time to order
- Using an unfiled trade name on contracts—this can create legal and tax complications
- EIN application gets held up because your DOS filing hasn't fully propagated through state databases yet

---

## STEP 9 — ADOPTING AN OPERATING AGREEMENT

New York requires PLLCs to have an Operating Agreement, even though you don't file it with the state. Banks, investors, and sometimes clients will request to see it, and not having one can hold up business transactions.

**Here's what to do:**

Draft an Operating Agreement that covers ownership, management structure, voting rights, restrictions related to your profession, compensation, buy-sell provisions, and banking authority.

Make sure it's dated within the required timeframe after formation (check current NY requirements).

Have all members/managers sign it and keep a copy with your other core documents. You don't file this with the state—just keep it in your records.

**What typically goes wrong:**

- Drafting an agreement that conflicts with your Articles or OP Certificate
- Using a generic template that doesn't address professional liability or licensing requirements
- Not having all members sign before needing it for a bank or business transaction
- Including provisions that violate professional practice rules in your field

---

## STEP 10 — STAYING COMPLIANT WITH BIENNIAL STATEMENTS

To keep your PLLC in good standing, you'll need to file biennial statements with the state. Missing these filings can result in your PLLC being administratively dissolved.

**Here's what to do:**

Set a calendar reminder for your biennial statement filing. It's due during the anniversary month of your formation (every two years). DOS doesn't send reminders, so missing the deadline is easy.

Keep a well-organized folder with all your core documents:

- OP Certificate of Authority (scan)
- DOS filing receipt (scan)
- Articles of Organization (final PDF)
- Newspaper affidavits and Certificate of Publication packet
- Operating Agreement (signed copy)
- EIN letter

When your ownership or management changes, make sure to update both OP and DOS so both agencies have consistent information. Discrepancies between the two can cause problems during licensing renewals or if either agency audits your file.

**What typically goes wrong:**

- Missing the biennial filing deadline → PLLC gets dissolved administratively
- Updating one agency but not the other → discrepancies that create problems later
- Not keeping good records → unable to complete the biennial statement accurately
- Address changes aren't updated → important notices from the state don't reach you

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

Here are the most frequent issues that derail the PLLC formation process:

**Using the wrong forms:** The Professional Service Articles of Organization look similar to the standard LLC form, but they're different. Using the standard form results in rejection.

**Name inconsistencies:** Your PLLC name must be identical (including punctuation, spacing, and capitalization) across every single document: OP application, Articles, publication notice, Certificate of Publication. One variation anywhere causes rejection.

**Publishing in the wrong papers:** Only county-designated newspapers count, and these lists change. Publishing in a non-designated paper means your entire six-week run is worthless.

**Missing the publication deadline:** You have 120 days from filing to complete publication. Missing this deadline suspends your authority to do business until you cure it by starting publication over.

**Incomplete responses to OP:** If OP sends a deficiency letter, answer only what they asked. Adding extra information or changes can create new issues.

**Losing important documents:** The state won't replace lost filing receipts. Without them, you'll have significant problems proving your PLLC exists.

**Assuming you're done:** There are multiple stages to this process, and missing any one of them can invalidate your entire filing.
