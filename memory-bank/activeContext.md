## Active Learning & Insights

### Project Patterns Discovered

- Need clear separation between public-facing pages and admin functionality
- Document management will be critical for legal compliance
- Email automation will be key for customer communication
- Status tracking needs to be both admin-friendly and customer-transparent

### Technical Learnings

- Next.js App Router excels at static site generation and SEO
- Spiffy.co forms provide simple payment integration
- Static sites offer excellent performance and deployment simplicity
- SEO optimization requires comprehensive metadata, structured data, and performance configuration
- Breadcrumb navigation enhances both UX and SEO with proper structured data
- Open Graph images significantly improve social media sharing appearance

### Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration & Behavior

**Critical Discovery**: Tailwind v4 requires explicit configuration loading and doesn't auto-load JS config files.

**How Tailwind v4 Functions in This Setup**:

1. **Configuration Loading**: Must use `@config "../../tailwind.config.js"` directive in globals.css
2. **Color System**: Colors defined as `hsl(var(--variable-name))` in config map to CSS variables
3. **Dark Mode**: `.dark` class triggers CSS variable swaps defined in `:root` and `.dark` selectors
4. **Server vs Client**: Root layout must be Server Component (no 'use client') for CSS to load properly
5. **PostCSS Integration**: Uses `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin for v4 compatibility

**Key Files & Their Roles**:

- `tailwind.config.js`: Maps Tailwind classes to CSS variables (`bg-primary` → `hsl(var(--primary))`)
- `globals.css`: Defines CSS variables and includes `@config` directive to load JS config
- `postcss.config.js`: Processes Tailwind with `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
- `layout.tsx`: Server Component that imports global CSS (critical for CSS loading)

### Business Insights

- Professional license verification is critical for PLLC compliance
- Publishing workflow is complex and time-sensitive
- Customer communication must be transparent about timelines
- All-in-one pricing model requires operational efficiency

## Current Blockers & Dependencies

### External Dependencies

- **Payment Forms**: Spiffy.co account setup and form configuration
- **Email Service**: SendGrid account configuration
- **Domain & Hosting**: Deployment platform selection (Vercel/Netlify)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics setup

### Internal Dependencies

- **Design Assets**: Need brand guidelines and color scheme
- **Content**: FAQ content, testimonials, legal disclaimers, service descriptions ✅ (PROJ-018 complete)
- **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags, structured data, sitemap, performance optimization ✅ (PROJ-016 complete)
- **Spiffy.co Integration**: Form setup and payment flow configuration (next priority)

## Communication & Collaboration

### Key Stakeholders

- **Business Owner**: Final decisions on features and priorities
- **Development Team**: Technical implementation and architecture
- **Legal/Compliance**: Ensure NY PLLC law compliance
- **Operations**: Publishing and fulfillment workflow

### Regular Checkpoints

- **Daily Standup**: Brief progress updates and blockers
- **Weekly Review**: Feature progress and technical decisions
- **Bi-weekly Demo**: Show working features to stakeholders

## Risk Management

### Current Risks

1. **Timeline Risk**: Complex publishing workflow may take longer than estimated
2. **Technical Risk**: New technology stack learning curve
3. **Compliance Risk**: NY PLLC regulations may be more complex than anticipated
4. **Integration Risk**: External service integrations may have delays

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Modular Development**: Build core features first, add complexity incrementally
2. **Early Prototyping**: Create working prototypes for key user flows
3. **Frequent Testing**: Test integrations early and often
4. **Legal Consultation**: Engage legal experts early for compliance questions
