## Known Issues & Risks ðŸš¨

### Technical Risks
1. **Spiffy.co Integration Complexity**

   - **Mitigation**: Test thoroughly and have backup payment options ready

2. **Professional License Verification**
   - **Risk**: Need to verify professional licenses for PLLC compliance
   - **Impact**: Could require additional form validation or external API calls
   - **Mitigation**: Start with basic validation, enhance as needed

3. **Static Site Limitations**
   - **Risk**: Admin dashboard may need more dynamic functionality than static site can provide
   - **Impact**: Could require backend development earlier than planned
   - **Mitigation**: Start with static HTML dashboard, plan for future backend integration

### Business Risks
1. **Legal Compliance Uncertainty**
   - **Risk**: NY PLLC regulations may have hidden complexities
   - **Impact**: Could require significant rework
