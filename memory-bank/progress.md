## Technical Learnings & Insights

### SEO Implementation Insights

- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Next.js metadata API provides excellent SEO capabilities with page-specific optimization
- **Structured Data Impact**: JSON-LD schemas significantly enhance search result appearance with rich snippets
- **Performance Optimization**: Core Web Vitals configuration directly impacts search rankings
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Enhances both user experience and SEO with proper structured data implementation
- **Open Graph Optimization**: Professional social sharing images improve click-through rates

### Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration Patterns

- **Configuration Loading**: Tailwind v4 requires explicit `@config "../../tailwind.config.js"` directive in globals.css
- **Color Variable Mapping**: Colors must be defined as `hsl(var(--variable-name))` in Tailwind config for CSS variable integration
- **Server Component Requirement**: Root layout must be Server Component (no 'use client') for global CSS to load properly
- **PostCSS Plugin**: Must use `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin for v4 compatibility
- **Dark Mode Integration**: CSS variables in `:root` and `.dark` selectors enable automatic theme switching

### Next.js Architecture Insights

- App Router provides excellent static site generation capabilities
- Server Components are critical for proper CSS loading in root layouts
- Turbopack may have issues with ESM PostCSS configs (use CommonJS .js files)

### Analytics Tracking Insights

- **Vercel Analytics**: Privacy-friendly, cost-effective conversion tracking alongside GA4
- **Lean Event Design**: Keeping properties ≤8 ensures compatibility with Pro plan limits
- **UTM Auto-Capture**: Automatic UTM parameter extraction enables attribution tracking
- **Component-Based Tracking**: Tracked components encapsulate tracking logic for reusability
- **Form Tracking Pattern**: First keystroke tracking (lead_start) provides early funnel insight
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests (81 tests) verify tracking works on every page and instance
- **Event Filtering**: Filtering undefined values prevents Vercel API errors
- **Order Time Tracking**: SessionStorage-based duration tracking from checkout start to purchase completion
- **Order ID Extraction**: Automatic extraction from URL parameters enables order-level analytics
- **Time Metrics**: Purchase events include `time_spent` (seconds) for conversion analysis
- **Spiffy API Integration**: Uses Spiffy JavaScript API (`checkout.on()`) to track form engagement accurately
- **Engagement Metrics**: Tracks `engagement_time` (active form filling) and `field_changes` (interaction count)
- **Engagement vs Duration**: Distinguishes between active engagement time and total checkout duration
- **Scroll Depth Tracking**: Tracks 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% scroll milestones with time-to-depth metrics
- **Scroll Performance**: Uses requestAnimationFrame throttling for efficient scroll event handling
- **Page-Specific Tracking**: Scroll depth resets on navigation and tracks each milestone once per page
- **Universal Implementation**: Scroll tracking added to all 18 pages (home, about, contact, FAQ, order, confirmation, legal pages, and all 9 profession pages)

### Spiffy.co Integration Insights

- **Embedded Checkout**: Spiffy checkout component (`<spiffy-checkout>`) embedded via dangerouslySetInnerHTML in order page
- **Script Loading**: Spiffy script loaded in root layout with account "nypllc" and afterInteractive strategy
- **Checkout URL**: Form points to `https://nypllc.spiffy.co/checkout/new-york-pllc-formation`
- **Analytics Integration**: Checkout start tracking automatically detects when Spiffy form loads
- **JavaScript API**: Uses Spiffy's `checkout.ready()` and `checkout.on()` API for form engagement tracking
- **Event Tracking**: Listens to `change:field`, `change:order`, and `change:paymethod` events for engagement metrics
- **Customer Data Collection**: Spiffy handles all customer information collection and payment processing
- **Email Notifications**: Zapier webhooks configured to send customer confirmation and admin notification emails automatically on order completion
- **Order Flow**: Payment → Zapier webhook triggers → Email notifications → Order confirmation page → Next steps communication
