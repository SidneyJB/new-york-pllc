## Known Issues & Risks ðŸš¨

### Technical Risks

1. **Spiffy.co Integration Complexity**

   - **Risk**: Payment form integration may have limitations or require custom workarounds
   - **Impact**: Could affect order flow smoothness
   - **Mitigation**: Test thoroughly and have backup payment options ready

2. **Professional License Verification**

   - **Risk**: Need to verify professional licenses for PLLC compliance
   - **Impact**: Could require additional form validation or external API calls
   - **Mitigation**: Start with basic validation, enhance as needed

3. **Static Site Limitations**
   - **Risk**: Admin dashboard may need more dynamic functionality than static site can provide
   - **Impact**: Could require backend development earlier than planned
   - **Mitigation**: Start with static HTML dashboard, plan for future backend integration

### Business Risks

1. **Legal Compliance Uncertainty**

   - **Risk**: NY PLLC regulations may have hidden complexities
   - **Impact**: Could require significant rework
   - **Mitigation**: Engage legal counsel early for compliance review

2. **Market Validation**
   - **Risk**: Demand for $885 PLLC service may be lower than expected
   - **Impact**: Could affect business model viability
   - **Mitigation**: Market research and competitor analysis

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions Made

1. **Next.js App Router**: Chosen for modern React development and SEO benefits
2. **Spiffy.co Integration**: Selected for simple payment form processing
3. **Static Site Generation**: Confirmed for optimal performance and deployment simplicity
4. **Tailwind CSS v4**: Chosen for consistent, maintainable styling with CSS variables
5. **Centralized Color System**: Implemented with CSS variables and Tailwind v4 integration

### Decisions Still Open

1. **Deployment Platform**: Vercel vs Netlify (evaluate based on static site needs)
2. **Content Management**: Static content vs headless CMS for dynamic updates
3. **Future Backend Integration**: When and how to add backend functionality

## Technical Learnings & Insights

### Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration Patterns

- **Configuration Loading**: Tailwind v4 requires explicit `@config "../../tailwind.config.js"` directive in globals.css
- **Color Variable Mapping**: Colors must be defined as `hsl(var(--variable-name))` in Tailwind config for CSS variable integration
- **Server Component Requirement**: Root layout must be Server Component (no 'use client') for global CSS to load properly
- **PostCSS Plugin**: Must use `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin for v4 compatibility
- **Dark Mode Integration**: CSS variables in `:root` and `.dark` selectors enable automatic theme switching

### Next.js Architecture Insights

- App Router provides excellent static site generation capabilities
- Server Components are critical for proper CSS loading in root layouts
- Turbopack may have issues with ESM PostCSS configs (use CommonJS .js files)

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Tiered service packages (basic vs premium)
- Payment plan options for customers
- Expansion to other states/entity types
- Automated professional license verification
- Partner referral system for accountants/lawyers
- Compliance monitoring subscriptions
