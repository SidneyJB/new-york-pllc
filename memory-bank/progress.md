## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions Made

2. **Spiffy.co Integration**: Selected for simple payment form processing
3. **Static Site Generation**: Confirmed for optimal performance and deployment simplicity
4. **Tailwind CSS v4**: Chosen for consistent, maintainable styling with CSS variables
5. **Centralized Color System**: Implemented with CSS variables and Tailwind v4 integration
6. **Comprehensive SEO Architecture**: Metadata API, structured data, sitemap, and performance optimization
7. **Breadcrumb Navigation System**: Accessible navigation with SEO benefits

3. **Future Backend Integration**: When and how to add backend functionality

## Technical Learnings & Insights

### SEO Implementation Insights

- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Next.js metadata API provides excellent SEO capabilities with page-specific optimization
- **Structured Data Impact**: JSON-LD schemas significantly enhance search result appearance with rich snippets
- **Performance Optimization**: Core Web Vitals configuration directly impacts search rankings
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Enhances both user experience and SEO with proper structured data implementation
- **Open Graph Optimization**: Professional social sharing images improve click-through rates

### Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration Patterns

- **Configuration Loading**: Tailwind v4 requires explicit `@config "../../tailwind.config.js"` directive in globals.css
- **Color Variable Mapping**: Colors must be defined as `hsl(var(--variable-name))` in Tailwind config for CSS variable integration
- **Server Component Requirement**: Root layout must be Server Component (no 'use client') for global CSS to load properly
- **PostCSS Plugin**: Must use `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin for v4 compatibility
- **Dark Mode Integration**: CSS variables in `:root` and `.dark` selectors enable automatic theme switching

### Next.js Architecture Insights

- App Router provides excellent static site generation capabilities
- Server Components are critical for proper CSS loading in root layouts
- Turbopack may have issues with ESM PostCSS configs (use CommonJS .js files)

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Tiered service packages (basic vs premium)
- Payment plan options for customers
- Expansion to other states/entity types
- Automated professional license verification
- Partner referral system for accountants/lawyers
- Compliance monitoring subscriptions
