            <p>
            We’re a small New York team that built this service after seeing how confusing the PLLC process can be for busy New York professionals. Too many people ran into half-answers, surprise add-ons, or just silence when they needed a simple update. We wanted another path: plain English, predictable steps, and real people you can reach.

            </p>
            <p>
            From day one, the idea was simple: do one thing well and do it with care. That means answering questions honestly, setting expectations we can keep, and finishing without drama. We don’t try to be everything; we focus on the part we’re great at and make it easy for you to get on with your work.
            </p>
            <p>
            We respect your time, we say what we mean, and we follow through. If you prefer to talk to a human before you start, we’ll make time. If you’d rather keep it over email, we’ll keep messages short and clear. Either way, you won’t have to chase us.
            </p>

              <p><strong>Clarity over complexity.</strong> We communicate like people, not policy manuals. No AI or chatbot shortcuts.</p>
              <p><strong>Promises we can keep.</strong> We'd rather under-promise than disappoint.</p>
              <p><strong>Kindness and speed.</strong> Quick replies matter when your work depends on paperwork.</p>

            <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-base leading-7 text-foreground max-w-none">
              <p>
              We kept meeting licensed professionals who were excellent at their craft and frustrated by the paperwork that stood in the way. The sticking point wasn't just forms, it was not knowing what was happening, what was required, or when they'd be done. We decided to build the kind of help we wished existed: steady, transparent, and human.
              </p>
              <p>
              If you work in a licensed field, you already carry a heavy load of standards and responsibility. Our role is to handle a small but stubborn hurdle with care so you can stay focused on your practice.
