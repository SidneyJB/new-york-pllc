    {
      question: 'Do dentists need NYSED pre-approval before filing a PLLC?',
      answer:
        'Yes. New York requires review by NYSED’s Office of the Professions (State Board for Dentistry) before the Department of State will accept your filing. We assemble a clean pre-approval package — name, purpose/scope, and professional statements — so it clears quickly and avoids back-and-forth.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Who may own a New York Dental PLLC?',
      answer:
        'Ownership is generally limited to appropriately licensed professionals authorized to provide the PLLC’s services. For a Dental PLLC, that typically means dentists (including specialists who are licensed as dentists). Administrative or management companies may provide support services under contract, but ownership and control of professional services must remain with licensed professionals.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can my Dental PLLC operate multiple offices under one entity?',
      answer:
        'Often yes. Many practices open additional locations under the same Dental PLLC with county-by-county publication and proper state filings as required. We set up your initial formation to support growth and guide you on how to add locations later.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What naming rules apply to a Dental PLLC?',
      answer:
        'Your name must include the professional designator (e.g., “PLLC”) and meet strict NYSED standards. Terms implying a specialty (e.g., “Orthodontics,” “Pediatric Dentistry”) should reflect your licensure and may trigger additional review. We provide compliant name options and handle NYSED name screening to prevent delays.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is the six-week newspaper publication included in the price?',
      answer:
        `Yes. We coordinate publication in two newspapers designated by your county clerk, manage proofs/affidavits, and file the Certificate of Publication. All included in the $${PRICE} flat fee — no surprise add-ons later.`,
    },
    {
      question: 'What will I receive to open a bank account and sign a lease?',
      answer:
        'You receive a bank-ready package: EIN confirmation, filed Articles, publication affidavits, and the Certificate of Publication — the documents banks and landlords typically request for dental build-outs and equipment financing.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does the Dental PLLC process take?',
      answer:
        'Timelines vary with NYSED review and the mandatory six consecutive weeks of publication. We start immediately, keep you informed at each milestone, and move each step forward as quickly as state processes allow.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can hygienists or non-dentist clinicians be members or managers?',
      answer:
        'Membership rules are profession-specific. In general, owners and those exercising control must be appropriately licensed to render the PLLC’s professional services. We help you structure governance so it aligns with NY rules and your practice model; for complex scenarios, we recommend legal counsel.',
