    {
      question: 'Do physicians need NYSED pre-approval before forming a PLLC?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Physician PLLCs typically require review by NYSED’s Office of the Professions (State Board for Medicine) before the Department of State will accept the filing. We prepare a medicine-specific pre-approval package — purpose language, name, and ownership — to reduce objections and delays.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Who may own or manage a Physician PLLC in New York?',
      answer:
        'Ownership and professional control are generally limited to appropriately licensed physicians (MD or DO). Cross-profession ownership is tightly restricted. We help structure members/managers to align with New York’s professional practice rules.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use an MSO to handle non-clinical operations?',
      answer:
        'Many New York medical groups contract with a Management Services Organization (MSO) for non-clinical services (admin, billing, HR, space). MSO contracts are separate from ownership — non-physicians do not own the PLLC. We craft governance that plays nicely with MSO agreements; for complex models, consult legal counsel.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What naming issues commonly delay physician approvals?',
      answer:
        'Names must be professional, include the required designator (e.g., “PLLC”), and avoid restricted or misleading terms (e.g., “hospital,” “clinic,” “center,” or claims outside scope) without additional approvals. ',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I provide telemedicine under my PLLC?',
      answer:
        'Yes, many physicians serve New York patients via telemedicine. Formation does not change licensure boundaries or payer rules — you must follow NY clinical, privacy, and platform/payer policies. We craft purpose language appropriate for in-person and telehealth care within NY.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can my PLLC employ PAs, NPs, or other staff?',
      answer:
        'Employment and supervision/collaboration rules are separate from entity ownership. Many physician practices employ PAs, NPs, and support staff under applicable professional rules. We align your operating documents with your staffing model; for detailed supervision/collaboration requirements, consult regulatory guidance.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is the six-week, two-newspaper publication included?',
      answer:
        `Yes. We coordinate county-assigned publication, manage proofs and affidavits, and file the Certificate of Publication — fully included in the $${PRICE} flat fee.`,
    },
    {
      question: 'What will I receive for banking, credentialing, and leasing?',
      answer:
        'You receive EIN confirmation, filed Articles, publication affidavits, and the Certificate of Publication — the “bank-ready” set typically requested by banks, hospital credentialing, payers, and landlords.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can a Physician PLLC operate multiple locations or service lines?',
      answer:
        'Often yes. Many practices add locations or service lines (e.g., primary care + urgent care). We structure formation to support growth and explain county publication implications if you add offices in other counties.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does a Physician PLLC typically take?',
      answer:
        'Timelines vary. NYSED pre-approval can add weeks or months based on volume; publication then requires six consecutive weeks. We begin immediately, set realistic timelines, and keep you updated at each milestone.',
    },
